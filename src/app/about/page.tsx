            Chuck is a 3rd year undergraduate student here at UW-Madison studying Computer Science and 
            Data Science. E-Waste interests him mostly because was interested in learning about what to with electronic waste
            after using it for so long. He always sees old leftover computers in various campus buildings and wanted 
            to know how exactly the university disposes of them.
