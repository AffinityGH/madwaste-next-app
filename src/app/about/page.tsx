          <p>
            Ram is a junior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. He is double majoring in Computer Science and 
            Data Science and getting a certificate in Mathematics. He is interested in e-waste because itâ€™s a major 
            environmental issue that also touches on technology. Learning more about e-waste helps him discover new ways 
            to recycle and manage worn out pieces of technology. He looks forward to spreading awareness about the importance 
            of e-waste.
